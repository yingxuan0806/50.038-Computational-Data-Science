1. Load the IMDB dataset using pandas

2. Pre-process the dataset by removing html tags, punctuations and numbers, multiple spaces

3. Convert the text to sequences. You may need the following steps 

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=5000) #Define a Keras tokenizer; from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

tokenizer.fit_on_texts(X_train) # Fit the tokenizer on the text

X_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(X_train) # Convert the text to sequences
X_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(X_test)

4. Classify the review into positive and negative sentiment categories. You may consider positive class as 1 and negative as 0. 

Use batch-size 128, 
optimizer - adam, 
learning rate - anything, 
validation split - 0.2, 
test data split - 0.2, 
epochs - anything, 
early_stopping - 10

The model should contain following layers 

4.1 -> A trainable Embedding layer with embedding size 100
4.2 -> A Dense layer on the embedding layer of output size 128
4.3 -> A sigmoid layer for final classification

5. Evaluate on the test data and print accuracy.

6. Print the model summary and model image

# Exercise 3

1. picture becomes clearer as number of principal components increases, more distinct
2. from the original square matrix, calculate the covariance matrix (via A^T A), then minus the mean vector (ie. minus the mean center) for normalisation/standardisation (this is a form of linear transformation), so that we can get the eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the diagonal of the matrix we obtain
3. covariance matrix of X
4. minus the mean center/mean vector from the covariance matrix
5. our purpose is to maximise variance in the principal components. the bigger eigenvalues implies more variances, hence decreasing order.
